### Multicast-Receiver

This is a simple reciever for multicast packets in the network.
Supply the IP address of group and port as command-line arguments as follows:

  > MulticastReceiver.exe 224.1.9.93 1993

Then the program starts receiving multicast messages of the group.
Notice that the messages are converted to ASCII strings before they get printed in the console.

Hope it helps :)

Sincerely,
